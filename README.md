BTC Identity Protocol v1 in Golang
==================================

this thing can only generate private and random keys, and then generate a SIN from it.

As the [Bitcoin Identity Protocol v1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Identity_protocol_v1) specifies:

```
A SIN ("Secure Identity Number" or "System Identification Number") is the
unique record identifier by which this identity will be known.
```
